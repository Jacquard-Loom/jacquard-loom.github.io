      <p>
         Software development is a creative art. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace" target="_blank">Ada Lovelace</a> said, &#8220;the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves.&#8221; It's also a communal activity. We create and push boundaries together. Jacqurd Loom is an open source organization with these two truths at its core. It's a place where we can learn & grow; it's a place where we do what's next.

      <h2>Open Source Collaboration</h2>
      <p>
        The heart of Jacquard Loom is its focus on free and open source software. There are two types of projects: organization driven & community driven. Organization driven projects are those that the founding team of Jacquard Loom lead. These projects currently include a web accessibility audit web app, an Express.js MVC generator, and a simple static site generator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community driven projects are those that anyone wishes to open up to the Jacquard Loom community for development and collaboration. The community itself will discuss project proposals and will decide which projects to take on in a transparent & democratic manner. If you'd like to join the community or submit a proposal, email <a href="mailto:vgabruzzo@gmail.com">vgabruzzo@gmail.com</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal here is essentially to build beautiful software and to give back to the open source community.

      <h2>Web Aesthetic Experimentation</h2>
      <p>
        It's one thing to say that software development is an art form; it's another to take that notion and to explore all of its possibilities. More information coming soon...

      <h2>Techno-philosophical Discourse</h2>
      <p>
        We ned to think about the implications of technology now more than ever. Jacquard Loom will host a community forum to do so. More information coming soon...
